                Hello, I'm Beulah Ude, a student at Obafemi Awolowo University, currently studying Material Science Engineering.
            
                I'm passionate about Tech, Web3, Volunteering, and Cooking. I thrive on hard work and resilience. Over the years, I've had the privilege of working on projects that can be accessed on my <a href = "https://github.com/Beutife">GitHub profile</a>, and I'm dedicated to continuous growth and impacting the lives around me positively.
            
                Outside of my professional life, I enjoy researching, cooking, and going on adventures. I believe that having good people with like minds around is a start for a brighter future. My goal is to bring light to my nation through technology.
            
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my work. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:udebeulah@gmail.com">send me a mail</a>.
